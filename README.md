# Renewable Energy Dashboard

An interactive data dashboard built using Python and Streamlit to visualize and analyze renewable energy metrics.

## Overview
This dashboard aggregates and presents renewable energy data through interactive charts and visualizations. It is designed to support comparative analysis of renewable energy performance, with a focus on wind and solar energy indicators.

## Features
- Interactive data visualization
- Renewable energy performance comparison
- Dynamic charts and tables
- User-friendly web interface

## Spatial Analysis
The dashboard includes a map-based visualization to represent regional renewable energy characteristics.

- Circles indicate renewable resource availability across different regions
- Additional markers represent supporting energy infrastructure
- Circle size reflects a composite score derived from multiple parameters

This visualization supports comparative regional analysis and helps identify areas with higher renewable energy potential.
